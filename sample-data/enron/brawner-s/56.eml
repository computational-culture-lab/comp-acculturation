I really appreciate you taking the time to be professional to me today.  You
could have easily passed on our discussions.

I hope you understand how important these issues are to me.  I have gone
over the entire evening with everyone to make sure I am not leaving a stone
unturned.

Thanks again.  I know we have an uphill battle with you, and I hope we are
up to the challednge.

Thanks,

Steve
