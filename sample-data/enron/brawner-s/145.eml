> In a crowded city at a crowded bus stop, a beautiful
>young woman was waiting for the bus. She was decked out in a tight
>leather mini skirt with matching tight leather boots and jacket.
>
>As the bus rolled up and it became her turn to get on, she became aware
>that her
>skirt was too tight to allow her leg to come up to the height of the
>first step on the
>bus. Slightly embarrassed, and with a quick smile to the bus
> driver, she reached behind her and unzipped her skirt a little, thinking
>that this would give her enough slack to raise her leg.  Again she tried
>to make  the step on to the bus only to discover she still
> couldn't.
>
>So, a little more embarrassed, she once again reached
>behind her and unzipped her skirt a little more and, for a second time
>attempted the step.
>Once again, much to her chagrin, she could not raise her
>leg because of the tight skirt. With a coy little smile to the driver,
>she
> again unzipped the offending skirt to give a little more slack and again
>was unable to make the step.
>
>About this time, the big Texan behind her in line picked
>her up easily from the waist and placed her lightly on the top step of
>the
>> bus.
> She went absolutely ballistic and turned on the would-be
>hero, screeching at him. "How dare you touch my body!!
>I don't even know who you
> are!"
>
> At this, the Texan drawled, "Well Ma'am, normally I
>would  agree with you, but after you unzipped my fly three times, I kinda
>figured that we was  friends."
