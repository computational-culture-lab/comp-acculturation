I am having a girls Christmas Open House Thursday Dec 21 from 6:00 pm to 
10:00 pm.  I have invited some gals in the industry and a few folks in the 
neighborhood.  I would love for you all to make it if you can.   There will 
be appetizers, cocktails and Christmas music so come ready for a little food 
&  vino.



My address & phone is:


8007 Sonata Ct
Woodwind Lakes addition   (off of 290 & Gessner/West Little York, the last 
exit inside the beltway)
713-896-9162


The house is just a couple miles off the highway so it is easy to get to.  I 
can make up a map if  you need me to.     Please let me know if  you think 
you will be able to make it.     Look forward to seeing you.
