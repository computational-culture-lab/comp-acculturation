Sandra,

My cousin sent me this.  It is so stupid but it made me laugh.

By the way the orthodontist called me last night.  What is he thinking?  I
was not home thank goodness.  SOLD!!!!!

I am not signed onto instant messenger.  I am doing some research this
morning.  I am really nervous about my interview today.

How was the massage?

Pam
