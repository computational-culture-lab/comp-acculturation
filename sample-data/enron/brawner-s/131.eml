Hello Kenny,

Just a note to say Hello and that I love you .  I enjoyed yesterday 
afternoon.  And I also wanted to thank you for getting up early this morning 
and fixing my coffee and my slim fast.  That meant alot to me, more than you 
know.  Enjoy your day - I will see you after my hair appointment tonight.  


Love and Kisses
Sandra
