Your not here for me to talk to so I thought I would vent through E_MAil.  
Jon it is 9:10 in the morning Thursday and Tom is the ONLY Gulf Amerex broker 
in again.  And I am so challenged that i could scream.   You guys need to get 
your shit together or throw in the towel.  It is certainly all of you guys 
business, but you have no idea how it affects mine.  You used the excuse 
about APB and the Derby, well APB has some customers in town today  and they 
have a full shop this morning.  And they plan to have 75% in tomorrow.  And 
Amerex is having 0% in on Friday.(because of APB's Derby)  are you getting 
the picture?  I love you, but I am getting very tired of defending you guys, 
you all make it harder and harder.
