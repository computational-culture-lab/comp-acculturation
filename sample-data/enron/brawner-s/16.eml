The SITARA system was brought down Monday night (12/4/00) for 4 hours for  
required maintenance.

This additional maintenance time as well as the normal nightly processing may 
delay the availability
of some portfolios early Tuesday morning. 

 The expected time for completion of priming portfolios for Tuesday is 
between 6:30 and 7:00 AM.

CPR will be available during this time.

Please call the SITARA/CPR Hotline ((713)-853-7049) if you have any questions 
or concerns.
