Sandra,

No need to apologize.  If there is anything I can do career wise for you, 
please don't hesitate to ask.  (Don't think of as one or two people as the 
entire organization).

Next time I'll give you more notice on the next cocktail party...

Funny about Wes, I had already bought a Ferrari, Aston Martin, Lamborghini, 
Porsche (turbo), and a Bentley.   He's such a follower.

Jeff

Jeff,
I needed to apologize for my inability to handle myself in more of a 
professional manner.  I thought I had moved on from being an emotional basket 
case , but as we found out, I haven't..  Again , please accept my apology.  I 
just need to move forward and stop reflecting on the past.  It is  so  
difficult when you have given your entire career for an organization that 
still doesn't see value in you.  But, that is my problem not yours.

In regards to your party , your right, I laughed at the invitation - (It is 
so Shankman)  - Sorry I will not be able to attend. But thanks for asking.

And lastly, Wes Walton how?  2001 Candy Apple Ferrari !!!
