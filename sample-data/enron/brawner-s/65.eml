Hello Bill,

It was great to get your note today.  I also think of you often.  Thanks for 
the complements concerning Enron, as always I am very proud of Enron where 
we've been and where it seems we are going.  Work is going well,  Business 
with Prebon is still null.  Has nothing to do with Cathy I think she is a 
great person and a  good broker, it just doesn't seem like they (Prebon) has 
any good information and markets anymore.  It is sad actually, ever since you 
left the group things have never been the same.  YOU made a big difference 
there.

Yes I would love to try and meet with you.  I need more information though.  
Things are kinda hectic here and at home so timing is everything for me these 
days.  Lunch is out of the question.  So we are looking at drinks or dinner.  
the week of the 20th is better.  The week of the 25th is not going to be easy 
cuz it is settlement week.

Pam is doing fine.  Still looking for a job.  Hopefully something will happen 
soon.  She had mentioned that you wrote a note,  I guess I got the impression 
she had replied.  She is a little stressed in trying to get things settled in 
her life so just give her some time.
