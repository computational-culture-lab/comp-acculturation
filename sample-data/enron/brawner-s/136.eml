Dear Sandra and Kenney,
?
I wanted thank you both for having me over for  dinner on Friday.? I had a 
great time and I  am so glad that I finally got the chance to meet Kenney 
and  Samantha.?
?
That Samantha is a doll.? She is certainly a  miniature Sandra.? She has that 
bubbly personality just like her  mom.
?
I look forward to seeing you guys again  soon.
?
I am off for Atlanta first thing Monday  morning.? 
?
Pam
