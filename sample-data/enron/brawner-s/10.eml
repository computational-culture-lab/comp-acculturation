	"How to Kill A  Blonde"
	
	Score: 65
	(posted by Shella on  07/31/00)
	
	One Day, A Blonde walks into a hair salon with  headphones on. The 
Hairstylist said:  
	
	"What would you like done today?"  
	
	The Blonde Answered..."I want to get my hair permed."  
	
	"Well, you're gonna have to remove those headphones first."  answered the 
hairstylist.  
	
	"But I can't! My parents said that if I EVER take them off, I'll  die!" The 
Blonde said  
	
	"Alright, I'm gonna go get the stuff I need, and when I come  back, you 
better have those off." the hairstylist replied. So as she  was walking into 
the backroom, the blonde appempted to take off the  headphones.  
	
	When the hairstylist returned, she found the blonde sprawled out  on the 
floor. She was dead. The hairstylist picked up the headphones  that were 
laying next to her. There was a voice on the headphones  saying:  
	
	"Breathe in, Breathe out, Breathe in, Breathe out, Breathe in,  Breathe 
out."
