I appreciate your note and yes it has been awhile since we spoke.  I do chat 
with Ray occasionally.  Steve without sounding abrupt I still have no 
intention of doing business with your shop.  That situation was difficult  
for several of us involved, and it is not something  that I believe I will 
forget. nor understand.  


Sincerely,

Sandra
