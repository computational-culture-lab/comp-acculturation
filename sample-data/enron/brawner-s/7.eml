Teresa,

Attached please find clean and blacklined drafts of the main documents.
Augie and I have talked with Milbank and plan to send them drafts of these
documents tomorrow, but we wanted to give you a chance to review them first.
Please feel free to call or e-mail us with any questions or comments.

Warm regards,
