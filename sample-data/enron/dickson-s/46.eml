Bobbie, 

Chris Walker said that this is a revival of the product that was worked on 
long ago and never finalized.  Do you remember what our concerns were?  I 
have sleep since then and do not remember.

Stacy,

Kevin Ruscitti has requested a secondary firm ANR ML7 phy gas product for 
EOL.  I have located some language that you and Dale worked on back in May of 
2000.  Please let me know if this language will be OK for our needs.  Also, 
will the current GTC for Phy gas need to be revised in any way?

Thanks,

CW

A US Gas Transaction with Enron North America Corp., under which Seller shall 
sell and Buyer shall purchase a quantity of natural gas equal to the Daily 
Contract Quantity at the Contract Price on a secondary firm basis. The 
Contract Price shall be as submitted by Counterparty via the Website.  The 
Period of Delivery shall be from the Effective Date through the Termination 
Date.
The term of the Transaction shall correspond to the date(s) set forth in the 
Product description on the Website.
The transaction is for delivery at the ANR Pipeline Company ML7 
interconnect.  The volumes scheduled to be delivered are subject to 
reductions due to normal operational constraints on the ANR  Pipeline Company 
pipelines based upon historical operating conditions.  The reductions caused 
by these constraints are excused nonperformance and are not considered a 
failure to receive or deliver firm gas.  In the event that the volumes 
scheduled are reduced due to such normal operational constraints, Buyer may 
designate a secondary firm delivery location.
The price is quoted in US Dollars per unit of volume, which will be the 
Contractual Currency.
The unit of measure against which the price is quoted shall be millions of 
British thermal units and the quantity shown shall be in millions of BTUs per 
day.
