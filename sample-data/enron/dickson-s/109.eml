Stacey, 

I'm sure you are aware that MSN stopped providing DSL a few weeks ago because 
their wholesale DSL provider, Northpoint filed for bankruptcy.  MSN sent me 
the letter below recommending we switch to Southwestern Bell.  Is this what 
ClickatHome suggests that we do?  Will I still receive a reimbursement for 
part of my DSL costs if I switch to SWB?  Please let me know what you suggest.

Thank you, 

Stacy Dickson Granmayeh

Dear MSN Internet Access Customer:

In an effort to help make your transition to another DSL Internet
provider a little easier, we have been working with Southwestern Bell
Internet Services and believe they may have a DSL Internet solution for
you.

Southwestern Bell Internet Services has a special offer for customers
affected by this transition with the following promotion:

Sign up for one-year and receive Southwestern Bell DSL High-Speed
Internet Service for $49.95 per month with a free modem (after $99
rebate) and a free self-installation kit, along with no provisioning fees
($149 value).

If you prefer to not commit to a one-year term, you can still sign up for
Southwestern Bell DSL High-Speed Internet Service on a month-to-month
basis for $49.95.

We have identified customers such as yourself who reside in the
Southwestern Bell service area and are recommending you contact them to
see if your telephone number and location qualifies for their DSL
Internet service.? You can contact Southwestern Bell on a special
toll-free number set up just for MSN customers, 1-800-962-5743. So,
hurry, this offer ends on April 30, 2001.

If you qualify, they have a group of specially trained support
representatives to assist you in making a smooth transition to
Southwestern Bell DSL Internet Service.

We hope this information is helpful and again, we apologize for this
situation and appreciate your patience.

Sincerely,
MSN HighSpeed - DSL Team
