This Term Sheet does not create and is not intended to create a binding and 
enforceable contract between the parties and may not be relied upon by either 
party as the basis for a contract by estoppel or otherwise, but rather 
evidences a non-binding expression of a good faith understanding to endeavor, 
without obligation, to negotiate mutually agreeable definitive agreements.
