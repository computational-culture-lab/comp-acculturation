Cyndie,

this provision.

Long time since I placed one of these to you. . . 

Okay, 
NORTHEAST GAS MARKETS, LLC; An EOL approved CP (Investment Grade); We have 
have a new GISB [Choice of Law = NY] & a Special provision (13.10) that I 
haven't come across yet whereas  - - - - - -  Enron recognizes that NEGM is 
acting as buyer on behalf of certain companies ("Repurchasers") to who it 
immediately resells such gas at the Delivery  Points, The Parties further 
agree that the term "transporter" shall include any company acting in the 
capacity of a transporter for any Repurchaser & agree that 4.3 will apply to 
invoices from such Transporters for Imbalance Charges received. - - - - - I 
can't see any reasons why this should cause this GISB to be excluded from EOL 
transactions, but wanted to make sure that there wasn't some deeper intent 
for the special provision that we would want to keep On-line transactions on 
GTCs.

Anything we should beware of?


Gee, almost feels just like old times. :o)


Thanks!
Cyn
