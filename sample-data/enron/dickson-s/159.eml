Gregg, 

Here is how to get a hold of me next week.

Cell phone (713) 269-4114
Grandparents' phone (870) 247-1352

Grandparents' address
403 White Hall Avenue
Pine Bluff, AR 71602

I do not think that my pager works in Arkansas.  It did not work in San 
Antonio.  I will find a fax number in Arkansas and give it to you.
Do not hestiate to call me.

Stacy
