Obviously, this is not final.  But it does have the letterhead.

Stacy - 
Steve spoke with Coral about the Transaction Agreements today.  They had the 
following comments:
Transaction Agreement #1
1 - MaxDQ should be 20,346
2 - 3.2 and 3.4 - LD payment equal to $0.15 plus 1.7% x Spot Price rather 
than $0.017 x Spot Price

Transaction Agreement #2
1 - 3.2 and 3.4 - LD payments consistent with Transaction Agreement #1 rather 
than $0.20 and $0.25

I think these are all fine, but I wanted to run them by you.  I have made the 
requested revisions to the attached Agreements for your review.  Let me know 
what you think.

Thanks - Gregg

transaction between Coral Energy Resources and enovate which includes the 
changes that we discussed.  Please call me at (713) 853-5705 with your
