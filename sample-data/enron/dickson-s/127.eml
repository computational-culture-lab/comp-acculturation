Hi Stacy,

Bridgette Anderson is currently briefing a new Enfolio Master Purchase Sale 
Firm with Cargill, but it is not an "Enfolio II".  It has provisions for 
collateral and includes an Enron guaranty and limited power of attorney.

I know if it said "Enfolio II", it would be okay to use it in EOL, and I 
believe it is good for EOL, but I want to confirm that with you.  Also, 
what's the difference between the two contracts?  Is it just the collateral 
provisions and guaranty that make it different?  I'd attach a copy, but it 
hasn't been scanned yet.

Thanks,

Susan
