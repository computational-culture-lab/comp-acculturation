I just caught a typo in the Spot version with credit.  Attached is a 
corrected version.

Melba, 

Per my e-mail, attached please find the new versions of the natural gas Spot 
GTC - on with and one without credit.  Also attached is a new version of the 
Firm GTC without credit.  There was a typo in the one I sent yesterday.  The 
Firm GTC with credit that I sent yesterday does not have the typo.

Stacy
