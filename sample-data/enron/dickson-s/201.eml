Heather,

I am glad to hear you (and your car) are o.k.  We did not have any problems.  
Those pictures are amazing!  The video of I-10 was unbelievable.  Dan and 
Marianne went to I-10 and saw the flooding in person.  He said the video on 
tv did not really show how bad it was.  Is there an estimate on when B  & P 
will be back in their offices?  It would be nice for you to have a couple of 
days off.

Stacy

P.S. I heard that Monica Jordan Richards left Enron and went to Entergy.
