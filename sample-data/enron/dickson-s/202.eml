Gregg, 

As we discussed... I would add the following provision at the end of the 
second sentence in Section VIII A. (3):

;provided however, in the event that Seller's invoice to Buyer is delayed due 
to Buyer not providing Seller the ANR information in the time period 
specified in Section V (2), the due date for payment of the Demand Charge 
shall be the twenty fifth (25th) day following the service month.
