Jennifer, 

What a cutie!  Meg is adorable and so grown up now!  She should start talking 
before long if she has not already.  I'm sure that you are teaching her to 
say Stacy.  I hope you guys are doing well.  I understand Mr Espey is not 
doing as well as hoped.  That must be particularly difficult for you guys 
since you are not near by.

When do you think that you will be in Houston again?  We miss you guys.  We 
got used to your being around last year.

Meredith is doing well.  She is starting to sit well on her own.  She still 
does an occasional face-plant though.  It really makes her mad when she 
does.  She loves her exersaucer.  We went to Arkansas for Easter so Meredith 
had her first plane ride.  She did very well.  I can't imagine entertaining a 
baby for five hours on a plane like you do!  Meredith has not mastered cereal 
yet.  We only feed her twice a week which does not help.  We keep joking that 
she will still be on formula when she goes to kindergarden!

I will send some picutures of Meredith soon.

Stacy
