Stacy -
 Attached please find NUI Utilities' comments on the Master
Agreement.  Also attached is NUI's form of Guaranty that has been reviewed
by Enron and will replace Exhibit D (it also contains some comments that I
have made in response to Enron's comments).  I understand that a revised
Transaction Agreement will be forthcoming from Enron.  Also, please be
advised that we have not yet seen a draft IDSA Confirmation between NUI
Energy Brokers and Enron.  It is our intention to execute all documents
simultaneously.  If you have any questions, please e-mail or call me at
908-719-4228.  Thank you.
