Jim, 

I found a copy of the confirmation letter for this deal.  I could not find 
the deal on the system so I will need to fax the copy to you.  Please give me 
your fax number.  I am sending a copy to Wade Price as well.  I could not 
find the cover letter that went with it.  My office was moved while I was out 
for maternity leave.  I don't think I ended up with all of my boxes.  I will 
keep searching and let you  know if I find it.

Stacy

Since this is an ENA deal, I wonder if you could provide me with a copy of 
the confirmation and cover letter where the deal below was mailed to this 
customer.  The details are in the bottom message. 

Thanks!!
Jim

Jim, my records show that the last transaction we did was with Bowie in May 
of 1999 and it was as ECT, not as EES.  I checked all my records and Petra 
checked my files this morning and we have nothing.  We also find nothing in 
the database.  Could it have been sent to ENA in error?  If you could fax us 
a copy of the documentation, we will be happy to prepare the agreement for 
you today and fax to the customer.  Thanks.

Christy

Christie:

Could you look in your database of confirmation letters, and see if you can 
find one for B & J Gas & Oil, c/o Bowie, Inc., P.O. Box 1430, Clarksburg, WV  
26302?  It would have been for 10,000/month on CNG for the period 3/1/2000 
through 2/28/2001 at the price of $2.79/dth.  I had in my notes that I called 
you on 3/3/2000, and you were going to fax a copy to Bowie and to Robert 
Cawthon with B & J Gas and Oil.  I need a copy of that confirmatio, as well 
as the documentation on when it was sent out to them.

Thanks!!

Jim
