Gregg,

Per our conversation, attached is a revised draft Master Firm Purchase/Sale
Agreement between enovate and Oxy for your comment.  With respect to Mary's
last draft, I have changed Section 2.4 back to having enovate only sending
confirmations.  Other changes that were previously made by Mary were in
Section 2.3 which now allows either party can maintain recording equipment
and Section 8.2 which reinstated the original transfer language.

Let me know if you have other questions or changes to be made before it goes
back to OXY.  Thanks, Rich.
