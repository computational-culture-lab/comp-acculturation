Stacey,

I do not have access to that database.  Attached is the Master firm that we 
have negotiated.  It will be executed today or tomorrow.

Stacy,

You'll need to fill out the following info for the Global Counterparty group 
in order to get NUI Utilities Inc. set up.  If you don't have access to this 
Lotus Notes database, please let me know and I can fill out the info for you.



Just let me know!
