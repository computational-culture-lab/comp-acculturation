Good morning, Stacy.
 I have reviewed the Guaranty forwarded last evening by Rudwell
Johnson.  He requested that I get back to you with comments.  Please note my
changes on the attached.  As Rudwell suggested, in the second paragraph  I
have included language that limits this Guaranty to the two transactions
that we working on.  In the same vein, I have also included language (see
paragraph 17) that ensures that any other guarantees will not be cumulative
with this one.  I assume that we will do a separate guaranty to use as
Exhibit D to the Master Purchase Agreement.  Any questions, please call me
at 908-719-4228.
