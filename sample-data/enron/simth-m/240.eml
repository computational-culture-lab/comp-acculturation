Yan,

The merged reports look great.  I believe the only orientation changes are to 
"unmerge" the following six reports:  

31 Keystone Receipts
15 Questar Pipeline
40 Rockies Production
22 West_2
23 West_3
25 CIG_WIC

The orientation of the individual reports should be correct.  Thanks.

Mat

PS.  Just a reminder to add the "*" by the title of calculated points.
