Well if you're still there, I hope the studying is going well.  Malo means 
bad.  I feel bad because today was a big cluster fuck on the socal system.  
The reason I feel bad is Jan was out today (she usually does Socal) and 
either Ted or I was going to fill in for her.  Neither of us wanted to do it, 
and Ted got stuck with it.  Well...I would have done it, but I was out until 
2 am last night and I didn't want to fuck up because of it.  Socal can be 
high stress because there are huge time constraints and its the most 
expensive gas in the country.  Anyway, a bunch of shit got fucked up.  It's 
not Ted's fault, but he really had a rough day because of it.  I think I 
might have been able to do a better job, but I knew there was chance for 
error because neither of us have done it in a while.  I feel bad.  
Regardless, I'm pretty whipped and am looking forward to going home.  Of 
course, I have a whole weekend of work to look forward to!  

Anwyay, it looks like I'm about done here, so I have one last word for 
you..........................Adios.
