Well, it wasn't that bad.  I was delayed a half an hour from Newark and then 
was only about a half an hour late getting into Houston.  I made it to bed by 
12:15 am and managed to drag myself out of bed at 5 am.  I have a bunch of 
work to do this week which SUCKS, but I'm interested and excited about what I 
have to do, so it's good.  Fortunately this scheduling thing has become 
second nature so I don't really have to think too much this morning.  How are 
you?

Mat
