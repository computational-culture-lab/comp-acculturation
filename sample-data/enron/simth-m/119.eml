Thanks for reminding me, I was in the process of emailing you, but I got 
distracted.  Anyway, it was working for Ken because he had someone's password 
coded into the file.  One of the IT guys found it and coded it into my file, 
so that I really don't need access anymore.  Apparently I have all the 
necessary software as well.  Thanks.

Mat
