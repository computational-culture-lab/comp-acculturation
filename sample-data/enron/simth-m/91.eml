Steve,

I'm real flexible on timing, but this whole - you may not be there thing - 
definitely restricts the possibilities.  What are the chances of a follow-on 
tour?  Won't the contract be renewed?  If your tour was indeed over, would 
how long would you be there both with and without a contract extension?  
Which weekend do you intend to be around and wish to have company.  The later 
the better for me, but seriously, I could probably get on plane next weekend 
if that was the only opportunity.  I'll give a call sometime, but I don't 
think I have the number anywhere.  Can you send it to me?  FYI, my numbers 
are as follows:  w 713-853-0472, h 713-784-8180, m 832-444-7702. 

Later dude.

Hey bruddah:

Great to hear from you!!!  So hey, you are ALWAYS welcome stay at my house
(as long as you don't water down my liquor bottles...).  The only glitch is
that my tenure in PR may be coming to a close.  At this point, our contract
is over on January 30th and it's unclear what will happen after that.  When
are you thinking of coming?  It sounds like your new job is cool.  The
diving is AWESOME!!!

Steve,

Hey, what's up my friend?  I hear that business is well in Puerto Rico
(although that was quite awhile ago so who knows).  I'm assuming that you
are, indeed, still there.  I can't believe that I've just finished my fifth
month with Enron.  It's been great, though.  Everything is new so I'm
learning a ton.  Working on a trading floor is quite a different
environment than Pirnie.  My desk is so small it reminds of Puerto Rico,
although there are no bomb threats, the bell does not sound at lunch,  and
the number of holidays does not exceed the number of work days in the year.
I've recently been accepted into a subprogram of the program I'm in to
become a trader, so my next year is pretty much planned and eventually I'll
start trading.

Anyway... I was just thinking the other day that I miss my trips to the
island (especially my accomodations at the Excelsior), and I can't help
feeling a little shorted that I didn't get a follow-up event of the Reggae
tour or diving trip.  So I was wondering if maybe I should come down some
weekend and make it right., you know put all of the planets back in
alignment.  So I was wondering if you might be able to put me up for a
weekend and maybe do some diving or something.  If not, then no big deal,
there's about zillion places I'd like to visit in the next few months.
Just drop me a note sometime and let me know what you think.

Please say hello to Pat, Joanne and Juan Carlos for me.  By the way, it was
bittersweet to hear Barry left soon after I did.  Had he done so sooner, I
would have taken his spot!  Anyway, wish everyone well and I'm curious to
hear what's happening on the island these days.

Take care,

Mat
