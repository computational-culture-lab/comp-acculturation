Tracy,

I believe I neglected to RSVP to you regarding the Associate orientation 
beginning February 12th.  If possible I would like to attend a portion of the 
activities.  Since I have been with Enron for five months, I do not think I 
should attend the entire program, but I believe the Derivatives, Modeling and 
Risk sessions would be of value to me.  Please let me know if I can still 
attend these sessions.  Thank you.

Mathew Smith
