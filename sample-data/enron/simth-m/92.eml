Hey cutie

It's all good.  I e-mailed Sharon and Bill and gave Duncan the skinny.  Bill
is in and he, Duncan and I are sending you the $308 asap.   I did not yet
hear back from Sharon but I have to assume she is in.  Also, Sandra
Lewis(GK's Sandra)  said she may be into the trip, just waiting to hear back
on that.

While everyone seemed to feel the 22nd-25th sounded fine they all expressed
interest in mid-march as well.  Did you find out when it might be availible
then???  I'll call you today for a final chat!
love, k
