Patti,

Chris said you had problems gettting to the manual entry website.  The link 
is http://fundamentals.dev.corp.enron.com/admin/manualentry/

Socal Manual Entry is the correct pipeline to choose (a slight change from 
Socal).  Also, we need to start entering the Clay basin numbers under the 
Questar Manual Entry pipeline, however, Chris Hyde is working to set up the 
page so that a delivery and a receipt value can be entered.

Mat
