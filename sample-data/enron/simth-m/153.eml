Hey Jennifer, I actually have a couple friends in town this weekend as well, 
and we'll definitely be looking for some of Houston's finest entertainment 
(and although the strip clubs are rated highly here, that's not what I'm 
referring to).  I'd definitely be interested going out Sat., but I don't have 
any suggestions as of yet.  I'll see what I can come up with.

Mat
