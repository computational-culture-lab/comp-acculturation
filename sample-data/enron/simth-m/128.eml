We need to work out a system here Kristen.  Why is it you are so freakin hard 
to get in touch with?  I asked you how often you check email, but you've 
never told me, once a day, week, what?  And this cell phone thing...Do you 
have it with you all the time...is it on...if not, how often do you check 
voicemail...how long after I leave a message should I expect to here from 
you?  I'm generally impatient, which is why it kills me to wait to hear from 
you, especially when I have not idea of what time frame to expect.  

Anyway, I really need to make plans, otherwise I'm going to go to Utah with 
Dave, or San Fran, or Puerto Rico.

Mat
