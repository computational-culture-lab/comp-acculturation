Matt,

Hey, thanks for returning my call.  As you're probably out from work, I'll 
try you again when I get in tomorrow (thursday).  I basically just wanted to 
touch base again since Ken has now moved on and left me with our synthetic 
storage project.  I'm also looking for a legal and EOL contact to help us 
develop a contract and run the bid process through EOL.  You may have 
provided these to Ken, but I can't get in touch with him.  Thanks again.

Mat
