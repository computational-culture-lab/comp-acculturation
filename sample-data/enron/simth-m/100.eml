OH MY GOD, THIS IS WAY TOO FUCKING 
WEIRD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

I sent you the message below earlier today and had two emails waiting for me 
this afternoon.  One indicating that I sent it to the wrong address and your 
email.  I can't believe it!  The worst part about it is that, yes, I am 
planning a trip to NYC, and I'm going to be there this weekend, which was the 
point of my email this morning!  HOLY SHIT!  THAT SUCKS!  I can't believe 
you're not going to be there.  When are you leaving/coming back?  I try to 
call you, but I don't know if I still have you're numbers (I've been useless 
since my Palm Pilot crashed).  Anyway, again, this is freaky.
