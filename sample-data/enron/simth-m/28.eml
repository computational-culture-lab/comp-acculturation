Since your names are the only ones I know in the off cycle program I am 
forwarding you this email.  please send this on to any and all off cycle 
associates you know.  I am going to contact Ted Bland to get a comprehensive 
list but this will have to do for now.

Subject: Ready to quit yet?!

It's hell getting back into the swing of things, isn't it?  Misery loves 
company, so share your tales of woe at our first post-training Happy Hour 
tomorrow night before everyone blows out of town for the long weekend.


Where:   The Ale House
Directions:   Take 59 south to the Kirby exit and go right (north) to 
Alabama.  Take another right.  A block down on your right, just past the 
Border's Books under construction, is the Ale House.  
When:  5:30 'til whenever

Hope to see you there!
