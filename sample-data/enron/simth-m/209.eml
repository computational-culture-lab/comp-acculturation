Team,

The attached spreadsheet identifies the manual entry points for each 
pipeline.  Please send me additional points for your respective pipelines and 
highlight in green.  Make particular note of any information that will be 
tracked on a schedule other than the standard cycle schedule of the relative 
pipeline.  The blue highlighted meters already exist in the database.  Where 
appropriate add the IHS DRN.  If it does not exist, leave blank and the IT 
group will create an ID using the description provided.  Please let me know 
if you cannot get this done by the end of the day, since I'd like Hyde to 
incorporate these first thing tomorrow.  Call me if you have any questions.   

Mat
