Regan,

Hey, I hope things are still going well.  I've been thrown right into the mix 
right away and have barely had a minute to breathe.  I'm scheduling gas after 
the morning trades have been made which basically entails lining up the 
buyers and sellers to exchange contract numbers.  However, it's a great place 
to learn operational logistics.  The intent is that I'll be productive in the 
role immediately while learning the ropes.  As they hire the needed full-time 
schedulers and I get up to speed, I'll move into market research for the 
traders.  My first such assignment is to value storage in different markets 
based on historical gas pricing and injection-withdrawel strategies.  Let's 
just say my plate looks to be full.

By the way, I'm sure you saw the previous email from our buddy, Ted Bland.  
Looks like he got the message, although I'm still feeling like there's still 
some orientation regarding the A/A program itself that we're missing.  For 
instance, did you see that there's a whole page in the intranet dedicated to 
the program.  It mentions month guest speakers and lunches.  I also saw 
mention of a mentoring program.  Of course, the A/A happy hours important as 
well.  I'd like to know more. 

Anyway, the real reason I wanted to drop the line is to find out if you're 
spending all your time in Georgia, or if you want to grab lunch sometime this 
week or hear of any after work activities that would help in meeting other 
people at Enron.  You can reach me at 3-0472.  

Later,

Mat
