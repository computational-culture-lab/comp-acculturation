Jeanne,

Per our conversation, I am requesting a check for the remaining dollar value 
from the relocation credit card provided to me.  The name as it appears on 
the card is Matthew Smith.  My new address is:  2345 Bering Dr., Apt. 514, 
Houston, TX 77057.  It would be great to have the check by the end of the 
week.

Thanks you.

Mat
