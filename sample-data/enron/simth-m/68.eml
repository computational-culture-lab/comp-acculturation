I agree.  Everything is just peachy up here.  My scheduling group wants me to 
stay in this rotation for another month, and I think Philip has ok'ed it.  He 
also thinks that for my next rotation, he'll just switch me with an analyst 
in the risk group that works on our books, soooooooooo....I'm curious how 
this "track" will actually affect me.  

Happy hour tomorrow?
