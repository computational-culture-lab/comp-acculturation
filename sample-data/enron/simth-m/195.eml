Dad told about you changing the ticket, but thanks.

sorry i didn't write this sooner.  it sort of slipped my mind, i think 
because it went so smoothly.  so, yes, i changed the ticket and everything 
is all set.  i did have to put the $100 on my credit card, but don't worry 
about it.

later-

jonathan

ps i got in another car accident that i didn't cause but still got blamed 
for it.  but we'll get into another time.
