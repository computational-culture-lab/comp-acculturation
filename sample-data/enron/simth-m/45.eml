Brief, 

Sorry for being such  a loser by not getting in touch with you a little 
sooner.  It's totally my fault.  Anyway, I do want to catch up with you 
sometime.  Also, I will be back in NY in two weeks, but only for one day.  
So, check your calendar for the Sunday after Thanksgiving.  I'm getting in 
early in the morning, so maybe we could go out to lunch or something.  I'll 
give you  a call sometime this week.  When are the best times to get a hold 
of you?  Here's some digits for you:

w.  713-853-0472
h.  713-784-8180
m. 832-444-7702
p.  713-716-0795

You can pretty much get a hold of me anytime.  I usually work till around 6 
pm.  Anyway, I speak to you soon.  

El Presidente
