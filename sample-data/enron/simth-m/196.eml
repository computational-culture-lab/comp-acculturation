waking up with a toilet by my head was a wonderful feeling!

and, boy did i feel great the next day.  Get this....I get on my little rinky 
dink plane to Philadelphia, and as i walk passed the flight attendant, i hear 
this voice................."mat?".   I turn and the flight attendant is none 
other than.........Heather Chapin!  Although she offered me all the booz i 
could drink, i could drink none.  i would have eaten some food if offered, 
but judging by the double-chin she has developed, i'm guessing she ate it all.

Anyway, from what i remember, i had a great time, although a little 
dissappointed at the Syracuse'esk finish of the rest of the Brother Jimmy's 
team.  I'll be thinking about you guys this weekend when i'm outside drinking 
my green beer.

About the trips...i don't know anything yet, except that Jazzfest is looking 
bad since no one can seem to find a hotel with availability.

Later,
Mateo

   Weekend of the 12-15 in April or the one following??
