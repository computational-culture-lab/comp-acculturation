Louis,

When I started July 31st, you arranged parking for me in the Regency garage 
until the time that a spot opened up to get on an Enron contract (I am not 
currently).  I haven't heard anything, and I know some people that have 
obtained Enron parking.  I signed my name to a list that you circulated at 
orientation.  Is there something further that I need to do?
